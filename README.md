# MyCivitas
MyCivitas is a GIS-integrated asset management application developed to address the unique needs of Canadaâ€™s small communities. CAM supports a three-phase approach to implementing asset management:

1. Asset Register: Capture asset locations and collect relevant data
2. Asset Prioritization: Prioritize assets based on risk
3. Capital and Operational Strategies: Identify capital projects and operational procedures to manage asset risk.

MyCivitas includes a web-interface for application users and a configured QGIS interface for application technicians. LandInfo Technologies and Kartoza are the official maintainers of MyCivitas.

```

On the next prompt line:

```
echo \
"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg]https:download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

Run apt update:

```

# Project Setup

## Clone mycivitas repository

This will clone the mycivitas repository to your machine
```
git clone https://github.com/landinfotech/mycivitas
```

## Set up the project

This will set up the mycivitas project on your machine
```
cd mycivitas
cd deployment
cp docker-compose.override.template.yml docker-compose.override.yml
cp sites-enabled/default.conf.template sites-enabled/default.conf
cp .template.env .env
make up
```
Wait until everything is done.

After everything is done, open up a web browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1/](http://127.0.0.1/) and the website will open.

By Default, we can use the admin credential:
```
username : admin@example.com
password : admin
```

## Set up different environment
To set up different environment, for example the Default credential, or the port of server, open **deployment/.env**.
You can check the description below for each of variable.

```
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=amlit

DB_PORT=5432
INITIAL_FIXTURES=True -> Put true for django initial data.

# Django env
DATABASE_NAME=django -> Default django database name
DATABASE_USERNAME=docker -> Default django database username
DATABASE_PASSWORD=docker -> Default django database password
DATABASE_HOST=db -> Default django database host

DATABASE_CIVITAS_NAME=civitas -> Default civitas database name
DATABASE_CIVITAS_HOST=db -> Default civitas database host
DATABASE_CIVITAS_PORT=5432 -> Default civitas database port
DATABASE_CIVITAS_USERNAME=docker -> Default civitas database username
DATABASE_CIVITAS_PASSWORD=docker -> Default civitas database password

# Email where alters should be sent. This will be used by let's encrypt and as the django admin email.
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com -> Default admin username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin -> Default admin password

# Email settings
EMAIL_HOST_USER=noreply@kartoza.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=docker
EMAIL_HOST=smtp
